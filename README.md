- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jenn; welcome to my GitHub. I am PM/BD professional with domain expertise in bioinformatics and cloud infrastructure via AWS/GCP. 
- ðŸ‘€ After working with a bioinformatics CRO for a few years as a bioinformatician and PM/BD, I am exploring my interests in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry to understand which path I should continue moving forward on. Although I do not have wet lab experience, I am looking to change my fundemental understanding of this and increase my knowledge in the dry lab. 
- ðŸŒ± I hold a Master of Science in Bioinformatics from Northeastern University with a concentration in Data Analytics and Machine Learning.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: please email me [1](jennijmartinez@gmail.com), send me a tweet on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_martinezjenn), and connect on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinezje/).
- Thank you so much reading and getting to know me a bit more. I'll be updating this Github and my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jennmartinez) account with personal projects in the near future.
